#Project-Quadcopter
---

This Project is a  very naive implementation of a mini quadcopter using Arduino and Mono,in order to simplify
the development of quadcopter.

##Features
---

+ From hardware to software design
+ Algorithm written in Arduino
+ Remote control with C# (Mono)
+ Wifi communication support
+ Camera and video streaming support

##Progressing
---

+ Complement filter : ====================> 100%
+ Motor mapping     : ====================> 100%
+ Power managment   : =>                     5%
+ Wifi support      : >                      0%
+ schematic design  : ==================>   90%
+ PCB layout        : >                      0%

##ToDo list
---

+ Kalman filter support
+ Sensor recorrect
+ ...
